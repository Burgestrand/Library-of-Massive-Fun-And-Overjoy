# Library of Massive Fun And Overjoy
LMFAO is part of an article about [Asynchronous callbacks in C extensions](http://burgestrand.se/articles/asynchronous-callbacks-in-ruby-c-extensions.html). It is meant to serve as an example project, allowing me to publish a complete working code sample.

## Usage
Download the project, make sure you have Ruby available and run `rake -T` to see available rake tasks and their description. Hopefully it’s straight-forward from there.

## How does this code work?
Good question! This is answered in detail in the article I’ve written named [Asynchronous callbacks in C extensions](http://burgestrand.se/articles/asynchronous-callbacks-in-ruby-c-extensions.html).
