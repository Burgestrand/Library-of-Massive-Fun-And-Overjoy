# Library of Massive Fun And Overjoy
LMFAO is part of an article currently in writing. It is meant to serve as an example project, allowing me to publish a complete working code sample.

## Usage
Download the project, make sure you have Ruby available and run `rake -T` to see available rake tasks and their description. Hopefully itâ€™s straight-forward from there.

## How does this code work?
Good question! This is answered in detail in the article that is yet-to-be published. When it is I will update this README.
